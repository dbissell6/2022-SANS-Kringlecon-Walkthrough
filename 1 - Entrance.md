KringleCoin Teller Machine

Welcome to the KringleCoin Network! We're glad you're here!

It appears that you currently do not have a KringleCoin wallet.  
You'll need one while you're here at the North Pole.  
  
Let's get started and set up your wallet.  
You'll earn KringleCoins for completing challenges or you just  
might be lucky enough to find some! Who knows!  
  
  
Your KringleCoin wallet consists of two values, a WalletAddress and a Private (Secret) Key.  
  
**_This is critically important: YOU are responsible for keeping track of your account information.  
  
If you come back here, we can tell you your WalletAddress, but (and this is very, VERY important)  
We CANNOT tell you your secret key. If you lose it, you lose access to your KringleCoins._**  
  
Here is your KringleCoin wallet information:  
WalletAddress: x
Key: x
